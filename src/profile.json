The curriculum focused on skills needed to build a funcitonal, mobile friendly website using the VSCode text editor, terminal, git and github. We added forms and tables to our HTML skillset. In CSS, we studied layout, enhanced design, mobile-first, debugging, responsive layouts, media queries, selectors, flexbox and grid layout. InJavaScript, we covered the basics including: variables, inout and output, numbers and functions, loops, arraays and objects."
